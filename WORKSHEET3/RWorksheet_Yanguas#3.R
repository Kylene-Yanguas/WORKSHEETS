#2a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of
#Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the
#object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.

#b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.
#Name the object as temp. Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow what
#is in the instruction.

#Using Matrices
#2. Create a matrix of one to eight and eleven to fourteen with four columns and three rows.
#a. What will be the R code for the #2 question and its result?

#b. Multiply the matrix by two. What is its R code and its result?
new <- matr * 2

#c. What is the content of row 2? What is its R code?
matr[2,]

#d. What will be the R code if you want to display the column 3 and column 4 in row 1 and row 2? What is its output?
matr[c(1,2), c(3,4)]

#e. What is the R code is you want to display only the columns in 2 and 3, row 3? What is its output?
matr[c(3), c(2,3)]

#f. What is the R code is you want to display only the columns 4? What is its output?
matr[,4]

#g. Name the rows as isa, dalawa, tatlo and columns as uno, dos, tres, quatro for the matrix that was created in b.'. What is its R code and corresponding output?

#h. From the original matrix you have created in a, reshape the matrix by assigning a new dimension with dim(). New dimensions should have 2 columns and 6 rows. What will be the R code and its output?

#Using Array

#3. An array contains 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1

#b. How many dimensions do your array have?
dim(array_dta)

#c. Name the rows as lowercase letters and columns as uppercase letters starting from the A. The array names should be
